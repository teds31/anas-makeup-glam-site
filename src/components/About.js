          Hello, my name is Ana and I'm a certified makeup artist based in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.
        </p>

        <p>
          For as long as I can remember, makeup and glamour have been a passion of mine. What once started as a hobby in high school, doing makeovers for my friends, I soon realized the transformation they were experiencing. The work I was doing was turning them into beautiful, confident women who were ready to take on the world. I discovered that this would be my calling in life and decided to follow my dreams by attending a professional school right here in Las Vegas.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know that makeup is my art and the human face is my canvas. I am intrested by every person I see, and harmonizing their inner beauty. I've had the pleasure of working with brides and models from <em>Quincea√±era magazine</em>, Expos and Foundations for Runways, beauty pageants and photo shoots.
        </p>
